SLAC is a formal language for the specification of Service-Level-Agreement for Cloud Computing.


The Tools is divided in two main parts:

    1- The Framework that: parses the SLA document and transforms it into a constraint; parses the monitoring data and transformsforms into a constrainst and checks
    the satisfatibility of the union of these constraints. In case of violation, the actions to be taken are returned

    2- The RPC Client which invokes the framework sending SLAs, monitoring data and requiring the verification of the conformance of the SLA. Multiple request can 
    be executed at the same time.

Use:
   In a terminal start the Framework.py - python Framework.py
   Send the SLA and the monnitoring data - E.g.: : python Client_RPC.py -s Examples/SLAs/Case_Study_1_3.slac -m Examples/Monitoring/Case_Study_1_Monitoring.slac


Requirements:
    ZeroRPC: http://zerorpc.dotcloud.com/ - pip install zerorpc 
    Gevent: http://www.gevent.org/ - pip install gevent 
    Z3: http://z3.codeplex.com/ - Source Code
    Simple Parser: http://simpleparse.sourceforge.net/ - Source Code


Examples:
    SLAs:
        ./Examples/SLAs/Case Study 1_1.slac - SLA without Guarantees
        ./Examples/SLAs/Case Study 1_2.slac - SLA with Simple Guarantees
        ./Examples/SLAs/Case_Study_1_3.slac - SLA with Complex Guarantees

        ./Examples/SLAs/Case_Study_2.slac - SLA describing a hybrid Cloud

    Monitoring Data:
        ./Examples/Monitoring/Case_Study_1_Monitoring_Sat.slac - Example of the Monitoring data that satisfies the constraints for case study 1 (from 1 to 3)
        ./Examples/Monitoring/Case_Study_1_Monitoring_Violations.slac - Example of the Monitoring data that violates the constraints for case study 1 (from 1 to 3)
        ./Examples/Monitoring/Case_Study_2_Monitoring_Sat.slac - Example of Monitoring data that satisfies the constraints for case study 2
        ./Examples/Monitoring/Case_Study_2_Monitoring_Violations.slac - Example of Monitoring data that violates the constraints for case study 2

*be careful when writting new SLAs and formatting monitoring data, being a prototype, the tool is sensitive to spaces, tabs, new lines and small errors.

TODO:
    Add 'not' to the terms
    Add all specified terms
    Implement Business Aspects
    Render the parsing less sensitive to spaces and order
    Return clear reasons for parsing errors
